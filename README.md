# DRQN-infectious-disease
Multi agent adaptive model for infectious disease dynamics using deep recursive Q-networks

This repository contains python models that use Shapley games for mimicking the behavior of subpopulations including the general public, government, and media during simulated disease outbreaks.  The purpose of the models collectively is to develop dynamic game-theoretic models for behavioral adaptation involving pre-established attitudes, learning, and alternative value-based outcomes within the context of an infectious disease outbreak.
